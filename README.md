# Code Template Examples

The purpose of this repository is to have a place to have commonly
used code in practice. In essence, a C/C++ toolbox that I can get practice
while creating and a place to look back to once it is implemented.

Things such as:

- Demo C++ classes
- opening, reading, modifying binary files
- working with smart pointers (std::unique_ptr<Type>)
- Using standard library functions (strcmp, memcpy, forward
- implementing lambda functions
- Initializer lists

TUI ncurses
